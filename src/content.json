    "body": "While Leap Finance dominates the pre-departure lending market, I identified a critical drop in engagement post-disbursal. Students land abroad with large sums of money but zero financial literacy in the new geography. As a Senior Product Manager, I conceptualized 'Leap Orbit'—a post-arrival financial wellness suite featuring Smart Pacing, Credit Score Gamification, and Squad Splitting to transform Leap from a one-time lender into a daily financial lifestyle app.",
